I am a nanofabrication engineer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab working in designing, engineering, and fabricating microdevices neural brain-implantable devices. My research interests are at the intersection of semiconductor processing, photonics design and simulation, and packaging. I am passionate about emerging micro and nanotechnologies and their implementation for next generation real-world nano scale devices.
